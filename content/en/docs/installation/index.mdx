# Using git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ermi1999/ahadu.git && cd ahadu
```

you can get started writing ahadu in two ways, one is through the **interactive shell** (**REPL**).

```bash
./ahadu
> አውጣ "አበበ በሶ በላ።";
አበበ በሶ በላ።
>
```

and the other is by providing a ahadu file

```bash
./ahadu file_name.ah
```
where filename.ah is your ahadu file name
