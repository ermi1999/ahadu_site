# Block Statements

A Block statements are a list of statements that are excuted sequentially. they can be helpful to excute a list of statement based on some condition you can define a block using `{}`.

you can't access variables that are defined inside block scope outside of the block scope.

```ahadu
መለያ global_var = 5;
{
    መለያ local_var = global_var + 10; // i can access a global variable from inside a block scope the result of this statement will be 15.
}
global_var = local_var; // [!code error] // I cannot do this because local_var is out of scope
```

but you can access a local variable from another scope as long as that scope is defined at the same level scope or below, consider the following example

```ahadu

{
    መለያ local_var = 5;
    {
        local_var = local_var + 1; // 6
        {
            local_var = local_var + 1; // 7
        }
    }
}
```

# Grouping

Grouping is a way for you to group statements with brackets.
