description: A for loop is useful to repeat a block for certain amount of time.
---

A for loop repeats a block of code while the condition is true. it has the following syntax.

```ahadu
ለዚህ (variable = expression; condition; increment) {
    // Block
}
```

## For variable

In the variable section you can declare a new variable

```ahadu
ለዚህ (መለያ ሀ = 0; condition; increment) {
    // Block
}
```

you could use an already declared variable and update its value

```ahadu
መለያ ሀ; // [!code highlight]
ለዚህ (ሀ = 0; condition; increment) {
    // Block
}
```

or you can leave it empty. but make sure to include the semicolon to indicate that it is the end of declaration section.

```ahadu
ለዚህ (; condition; increment) {
    // Block
}
```

## For condition

A for condition is useful to set up a loop breaking condition. which means the loop will only run while the condition section is true.

<Warning>
  leaving the condition empty will cause an infinite loop. so only leave the
  condition empty when you want an infinite loop.
</Warning>

```ahadu
ለዚህ (መለያ ሀ = 0; ሀ < 10; increment) {
    // Block
}
```

this for loop runs while ሀ is less than 10.

<Info>
  If you don't know how many times the loop should run, it is best practice to use the<Link className="text-primary hover:text-off-blue transition-colors" href="/en/docs/the-language/while-statement"> while </Link> loop.

## For increment

A for increment will be executed after each iteration which will allow you to update a value a after each iteration.

```ahadu
ለዚህ (መለያ ሀ = 0; ሀ < 10; ሀ = ሀ + 1) {
    // Block
}
```

the above example will increment ሀ after each iteration, which means this for loop will run 10 times.
