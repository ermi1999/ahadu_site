# Lexical Conventions

Ahadu follows the good old c like syntax so you should be familiar with it. and also it is a free-form language.
it ignores spaces between lexical elements (Tokens).

Names (also called identifiers) in Ahadu can be any string of Latin letters, Amharic letters and underscores not beginning with a digit and not being a reserved word. Identifiers are used to name variables, classes and functions.
