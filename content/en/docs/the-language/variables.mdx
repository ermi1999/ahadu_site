# Declaring variables

```ahadu
መለያ ስም;
```

where `ስም{:ahadu}` is the identifier of the variable. Identifiers can be any string of Latin letters, Amharic letters and underscores not beginning with a digit and not being a reserved word. as mentioned in <Link className="text-primary hover:text-off-blue transition-colors" href='/en/docs/the-language#lexical-conventions'>Lexical Conventions</Link>.

every variable is assigned to nil (ባዶ) value unless you explicitly pass the value.

```ahadu showLineNumbers
መለያ ስም;
መለያ ሌላ_ስም = ባዶ;
```

here both ስም and ሌላ_ስም are nil (ባዶ).

```ahadu
መለያ ስም;
መለያ ሌላ_ስም = ባዶ;
ስም = 1; // [!code highlight]
```

here i assigned 1 to ስም, now the value is 1.

# Variable types

There are two types of variables in ahadu: global variables and local variables.

## Global variables

A global variable is a variable that is declare outside of any <Link className="text-primary hover:text-off-blue transition-colors" href='/en/docs/the-language/block-statements-and-grouping#block-statements'>block (scope)</Link>. and is accesible from any <Link className="text-primary hover:text-off-blue transition-colors" href='/en/docs/the-language/block-statements-and-grouping#block-statements'>block (scope)</Link>.

## Local variables

A local variable is a variable that is accesible from only the <Link className="text-primary hover:text-off-blue transition-colors" href='/en/docs/the-language/block-statements-and-grouping#block-statements'>block (scope)</Link> where it is declared.
